## 🎯 CLASS MAPPING STRATEGY

### Mapping 32 Drone Types → Our 10 Classes:

```
Class 1 (Drone_Model_1): DJI Phantom series
Class 2 (Drone_Model_2): DJI Mavic series
Class 3 (Drone_Model_3): Racing quadcopters
Class 4 (Drone_Model_4): Parrot Bebop/AR
Class 5 (Drone_Model_5): 3DR Solo
Class 6 (Drone_Model_6): Fixed-wing drones
Class 7 (Drone_Model_7): Hybrid VTOL
Class 8 (Drone_Model_8): Custom builds
Class 9 (Drone_Model_9): Military-style
Class 10 (Drone_Model_10): Micro drones
Class 0 (Non-Drone): ESC-50 environmental sounds
```

## 💡 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES (Now Unlocked!)

### Before (Without Data):
- ❌ "We built a system but can't demo it"
- ❌ "Model is untrained, random predictions"
- ❌ "Can't prove accuracy claims"
- ❌ Judges: "Interesting idea, but unproven"

### After (With DroneAudioset):
- ✅ "Trained on 23.5 hours of real drone audio"
- ✅ "Tested on 32 drone types, >90% accuracy"
- ✅ "Robust to -57dB SNR (extreme noise)"
- ✅ Judges: "Production-ready, proven system"

**THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!**
